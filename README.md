Currently this tool is hard coded to use wordlist.txt as its wordlist. The server to scan and number of threads to use is configurable on the command line, however.


    node scan http://www.example.com 10


Will scan www.example.com using 10 threads. Results will be saved as scan.txt in the current directory.
